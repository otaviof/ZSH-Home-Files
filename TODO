1) Install (Makefile?) scripts using this repo as base:
    1.1) How to deploy this files? Maybe using Python be a good way (learn
         something as well);
2) Features by SOs (OSX, FreeBSD and Linux -- debian-like):
    * Alias (Booking's related ones);
    * Man2Vim (on and off states);
    * PATH (one by SO);
3) How call features separately?;
4) How to configure where to install files?;
